Etch-a-Sketch Project from Odin.

*The main issue it currently has is that it does not work well with
values that are not divisible by the board size.*

-Scratch that. I only tested in on firefox and turns out this does not happen
on edge, chrome or arc. Apparently it works fine on those. Maybe it has something to do with
chromium? Maybe I'll try to fix it later when (and if) I get to css media queries.

It is pretty bare-bones, has no color choice and such and it's pretty bad in general. 
Should be able to add color choices *after the value thing is fixed*, but i'm 
gonna leave it at that for now.
