Etch-a-Sketch Project from Odin.

The main issue it currently has is that it does not work well with
values that are not divisible by the board size. 

It is pretty bare-bones, has no color choice and such and it's pretty bad in general. 
Should be able to add color choices after the value thing is fixed, but i'm 
gonna leave it at that (for now).
